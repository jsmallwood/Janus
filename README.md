# Introduction 
[Janus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus) is a governance framework for enabling DevSecOps in an organization using Azure and Azure DevOps. Janus, god of gates, provided the root of the English word "Janitor", so this project name is a play on the concept of the "Cloud Custodian" as a "Cloud Janitor" ;) When rolling out a governance framework, remember the adage: ["quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F)
