## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request. It is for this reason that Work Items are not required for a PR to be allowed on the master branch.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
